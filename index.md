As I complete my academic journey with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I reflect not only on the knowledge and theory I've gained in the classroom, but also the real-world experience I've acquired over the past five years working professionally as a Site Reliability and Cloud Systems Engineer. I've had the privilage of gaining hands-on experience in the industry while simultaneously completing my academic studies. 

Now, with my degree and years of real-world experience in my hand, I'm excited to present this portfolio. It hightlights tools and systems that have shaped my career, and culminates in a single Android, Java-based project.


# Bridging Theory and Practice
---
Being able to both study and practice everything that has been presented in my academic career has allowed me to gain a more thorough understanding of the basic principles and theory taught while at the same time enhancing my deliverables at work. 

While pursuing my degree, I had the unique opportunity to apply classroom concepts directly to real-world challenges. Courses in operating systems, data structures, distributed systems, and software engineering deeply enriched my understanding of the technologies I use daily. For example, learning about the CAP theorem in class helped me better optimize fault-tolerant configurations of distributed NoSQL databases like Apache Cassandra and Oracle NoSQL databases.

A unique example of the intersection between my academic studies and my professional career came by a time when I was working on developing a performance testing tool at work that would allow me to understand the differnces in performance between three databases, Apache Casssandra, Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle NoSQL. At the time, I was revisiting concepts and theories that had been the focus of my study in earlier courses but this time for MongoDB. By implementing object-oriented programming, I was able to understand and apply concepts of abstract methods in Python and interfaces in Java to deliver academic and professional projects.


# Programming Skills: Java and Python
---
Both Java and Python have been instrumental in my growth—academically and professionally. Java gave me strong fundamentals in object-oriented programming and has been critical in developing the Android application featured in this portfolio. Meanwhile, the versatility that Python provides has allowed me to write automation scripts, and build quick applications to connect, interact, and run performance tests on a variety of databases.


# Professional Experience: From Cloud Infrastructure to Code
---
Throughout my career as a Cloud Systems Engineer, I have been responsible for architecting scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure using tools like Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins and TeamCity. I’ve helped maintain cloud-native applications that operate across multi-region clusters which handle thousands of requests per second.

I’ve also maintained and developed backend services using Java, focusing on performance tuning, service reliability, and observability (using tools like Prometheus and Grafana).


# Capstone Project: Inventory Management (Android Application)
---
To tie together my academic and professional background, I've developed a full-featured inventory management application for Android, written in Java, using Android Studio. This project served as my capstone, bringing together a wide array of concepts I’ve studied—from object-oriented design and user interface development to client-server architecture and cloud database integration.

At its core, the application allows users to register and log in securely, add and manage inventory items in real time, and intuitively interact with a modern, responsive interface powered by RecyclerView. In the backend, all data is synchronized through Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring resiliency and consistency across devices with seamless cloud integration.

This project is particularly meaningful as it not only encompasses everything that I've learned while attending university, but also some of the knowledge and experience that I've acquired over the years as a professional. The architecture of the application is modular and maintainable, with clear separation of functions and uses. Every class and test is properly documented so that future development and collaboration is made easier and does not break the underlying functions it provides.

This application demonstrates my technical ability, and it represents the type of thoughtful, end-to-end engineering I aspire to bring to every project I work on.
